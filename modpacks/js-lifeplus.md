This modpack aims to make Survival Let's Plays and SMP server experiences more enjoyable. It offers significantly more improvements and features than the [JS Basic Play](https://modrinth.com/modpack/js-basic-play) modpack.

This modpack may be restricted on some public servers due to mods like MouseTweaks or ClientSort. Use it at your own risk and stay informed about server rules.

## Features

* **Small performance Optimizations:** Built on the latest Fabric loader with essential mods like Sodium, Lithium, and FerriteCore for a smooth experience.
* **Quality of Life:** Enhancements like dynamic crosshairs, better UI handling, Freecam, and more.
* **Visual Improvements:** Includes Iris Shaders, EuphoriaPatches, and 3D Skin Layers for a modern and polished look.
* **Vanilla-Friendly:** Subtle gameplay changes that preserve the classic Minecraft feeling you know and love.
